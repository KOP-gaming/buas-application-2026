puzzle platformer day one (03/09/2025)
- started playing that level again for inspiration
- started playing cat mario for inspiration
- continued playing geometry dash and low oxygen for inspiration
- started working on tutorial level 1
- created working movement
- made it so that if you stop moving mid air you keep some of your spseed instead of dropping straight down
- played around with a static cam and a player following cam
- decided that camera options will depend on the level
